\begin{itemize}

\item A: \\
$$(td-c)\cdot(td-c)-R^2$$
$$(td\cdot td)+2(td\cdot c) + (c\cdot c)-R^2$$
$$(t^2 (d\cdot d) + t2(d\cdot c) + (c \cdot c) -R^2$$
$$(t^2 17 + t2*12 + 9 -1)$$
$$(t^2 17 + t*24 + 8 )$$
Then via quadratic formula: 
$$ \frac{- 24 + 4\sqrt(2)} {36}$$ I pick this one, as -24 is negative, and the closest $t$ will be the one closest to zero.
$$ t \approx 0.50531$$
Giving the vector: $[0, 0.509531, -2.0381]$
\item B: \\

This is just a cross product of two vectors that are in the triangle: $(p_0 -p_1) x (p_0 - p_2) = [0,6,12] = [0,1,2]$

\item C: \\


$$[0,-1,4] t + [-2,1,-3] \cdot [0,1,2] = 0$$

$$[-2,-t+1,4t-3] \cdot [0,1,2] = 0$$

$$-t +1 +8t-6 = 0$$

$$7t - 7 =0$$
$$t=1$$

\item D: \\

\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & -3  \\
-1 & 4 & 0  \\
4 & -2 & 0  
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ u \\ v
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
-2 \\ 1 \\ 3
\end{bmatrix} \\
Which gives us 3 equations:
$-3v = -2 , -1+4u = 1, 4 -2u =3$ \\
Which solve to:
$$v=2/3, u=1/2, u=1/2$$
Which gives us a $w = (1-2/3-1/2) = -0.1666...$ Which, is negative, and hence the ray does not intersect the triangle.
 
\end{itemize}
