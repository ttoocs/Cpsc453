\begin{itemize}

\item A: \\
Depending on how one wants to look at the sphere, it has 144 or 120 triangles. (The difference of the 24 triangles are 12 at the top and 12 at the bottom, where the triangle itself is just infinitely thin) \\

One way of counting them is to note that there are 12 "circles" made, of 12 points. Giving the connections between any two circles as 24. As these circles wrap around the entire sphere, you need only to count 6 groups of these. Giving a total of $144$. (Where $24$ of these triangles are really just lines, as the circle has radius 0 (ie, only 1 point on the top/bottom) giving $120$.) \\

\item B: \\
Doing a horrible approximation of $\sin(90)/\sin(30)$, where this would only represent the a single axis, and assuming the $y$ axis behaves the same, this gives you a value of $2$. \\

\end{itemize}
