\begin{itemize}

\item A:
$\frac{360deg}{27.3days} \frac{1day}{1sec} \frac{60 seconds}{1 frame} = 791.21 deg= 71.21 deg$ per frame

\item B:
Depends on what direction the rotation the sun has with respect to earth's. \\
Ex: If it's $90 deg$ offset with earths, there will be $365$ precived rotation time (However, it will be slightly offset from where it started.. a full 3D rotational "peroid" being 9271 days) \\
If it's in-line with earth: $365/25.4 = 14.370$ \\
If it's counter in-line with earth: $365*25.4 = 9271$ \\

Not entierly sure, but the equation for this seems to be something like $peroid \propto 365* 25.4^{cos(\theta)}$.
\end{itemize}
