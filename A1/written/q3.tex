\item Done via looking at it, and basic trig functions.
\begin{itemize}
\item $x=0.5,y=sin(60) = 0.86603$
\item $x=0.5*cos(60)+.5 = 0.75, y=sin(60)*.5=0.43301$
\item $x=.5-(cos(60*.25), y=sin(60)*.25 = 0.21651$
\end{itemize}

\item As each iterations multiplies the available squares by 8, the number of squares per level $= 8^{\text{level}-1}$, which results in the maximum level being 7, with $262144$ squares.

\end{itemize}
