Geometric Representations:

\subsection{Discrete}
-"Samples" of a curve
-points and/or lines.
-We assyme we can represent things with points and lines.
-Storing it in a general methoid (IE, no circle function, no square, no triangle.)
-For a circle: We would sample the curve of a circle, and and connect the lines.. this requires inf samples.
-For a square: Perfectly good!

Note: OpenGL will only draw, points, lines and triangles. (Point - 0 simplex, line - 2 simplex, triangle - 3 simplex.)

\subsection{Implicit}

-Start with an explicit form: y=x^2
Implicit form: $x^2+xy+y^2-4=0$

\subsection{Parametric}
-Composition of explicit forms.
\subsection{Generative}
